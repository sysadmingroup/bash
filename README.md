Hi there ! 

I have built this respository to store my notes and practice sessions of bash. 

Eventually I would like to convert this into a handybook for bash. 

I am not an expert and I am not a computer scientist.

I am studying this to supplement my sys admin certification. 

Below are the topics that I will be covering in my journey. 

- Basic Text Manipulation 

- Variables 

- Test

- If Else 

- Command Line Arguments 

- For Loop

- While Loop

- Functions 

- Sed

- Awk Scripting 

- Projects

- Automation 


This work is an ongoing process and I hope to compelete all of the above sooner than later. 


You can use the scripts that will be made available at your own risk.
